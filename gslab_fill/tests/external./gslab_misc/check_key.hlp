Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	check_key [using filename], key(variable names) [sort]

Description
-----------

check_key checks that the data set in memory or specified by the using option has a valid key.  
Specifically it checks that the key variable(s) listed in the required key option contain no missing values 
and that the key variable(s) uniquely identify each observation in the data set.

If the key fails one of the tests, a message describing the cause of the failure and an error code "r(198)" 
are printed to the log, and the program stops running.


Options for use with check_key

    If multiple variables are listed they are delimited by spaces.

using: Specifies which data set to check if the user wants to check 
    a data set that is not in memory.

sort: Checks that the data set is sorted ascending by the key variables,
