Plot coefficients after a regression
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	syntax [anything], [estimates(string) b(string) se(string) graphs(string) label(string) cumulative(string) combine *]

Description
-----------

^plotcoeffs^ plots regression coefficients in either a line, scatter, bar or connected plot. The 
line and scatter plots include error lines. The graphs are plotted in the the order of the specified 
coefficient estimates. 

Note: This program understands factor variable syntax.  However, since its inputs do not include what
regression you just ran, it does not know if any factor variables were dropped due to collinearity.  
In such cases, giving plotcoeffs an input in factor variable syntax will lead it to plot the dropped 
"0" coefficient(s) for collinear variables. To avoid this, do not use factor variable syntax if your 
regression treated one or more of your factor variables as collinear.

Options for use with ^plotcoeffs^
---------------------------

^estimates(string)^ is optional. It specifies which stored estimates, created using estimates 
	store, to use for plotcoeffs. If omitted, then the current estimates  in the ereturn list will 
	be used. Estimates() can take wildcards that appear at the end of 'words' (i.e., sequences of 	
	symbols separated from other sequences by spaces).

^b(string)^ is optional. It reads the name of a nx1 vector of coefficient point estimates. It cannot 
	be specified with ^varlist(ts)^ and ^estimates(string)^. If ^b(string)^ is specified, so must 
	^se(string)^. If omitted, then the estimates currently in ereturn list will be used.

^se(string)^ is optional. It reads the name of a nx1 vector of coefficient standard error estimates. 
	It cannot be specified with ^varlist(ts)^ and ^estimates(string)^. If ^se(string)^ is specified, 
	so must ^b(string)^. If omitted, then the estimates currently in ereturn list will be used.

^graphs(string)^ is optional when estimates() either is ommitted or contains one input. It 
	specifies the graph type, which can be bar, line, linenose (line w/ no std errors)
	err (i.e., scatter plot with error bars), nose (i.e., scatter plot without error bars), or 
	connect (connected plot, no std errors). The default is err. If estimates() contains 
	multiple inputs, then graphs() must contain an equal number and will be applied to the 
	estimates() input in the corresponding order.

^label(^string^)^ is optional. It specifies labels for the x-variables in ^varlist^ and applies them 
	in the order they are listed in the command syntax. If the combine command is specified and 
	estimates for the same variable appear in multiple stored estimates, then the labels are applied 
	in the order of the stored estimates and variables as listed in the syntax.

^combine^ is optional. It places all estimates in one 'time-series'. It can only be specified with 
	estimates().

^cumulative(^string^)^ is optional. It allows the user to specify whether to cumulatively sum the 
	variable beta coefficients in the order that they appear. A "1" indicates to cumulatively sum 
	the coefficients whereas as a "0" indicates otherwise. If multiple estimates are included in 
	estimates(), then the number of binary indicators in cumulative() must match the number of 
	estimates and they will correspond by their order. Note that cumulative() does not work with the 
	b() and se() options.
	
One can include other options (indicated by *) that will be passed onto the graph. Default options 
	are "scheme(s1mono) yline(0, lcolor(gs12)) ytitle(Coefficient) xtitle(Variable) xlabel(#`max', 
	value angle(vertical)) legend(off)". Changing one default option will only overwrite that one 
	default.  E.g. One can send just "ytitle(Big Coefficient)" without overwriting scheme or yline 
	defaults.
	
Note: This program requires the installation of svmat2.
